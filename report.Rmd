### **Engagement Report Group 8**
**Angelo Marra, Chang Liu, Karl Protil III, Melissa Chapnick**
\
\
This analysis explored relationships between factors such as video length and video number with video views among students in the INFO 550 course.
\
\

#### **Tabular Analysis**
\
Table 1 reports characteristics of course videos by topic including # of views, # of unique viewers, and video length in minutes. 
\
\
```{r}
readRDS(file=here::here("INFO550ENGAGEMENT/output/table1.rds"))
```
\
\

#### **Graphical Analysis**
\
Figure 1 displays the average total length of videos by topic. 
\
\
```{r}
readRDS(file=here::here("INFO550ENGAGEMENT/output/figure1.rds"))
```
\
\
Figure 2 displays the relationship between # of video views by video length. We see there is a slight positive correlation between video views and video length.

\
```{r}
#| fig.align = "center",
#| out.width = "600px"
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("INFO550ENGAGEMENT/output/angelo_analysis.png"))

\
\
Figure 3 displays the relationship between the number of videos per topic and proportion of students who engaged with the videos. We see a slight negative correlation between number of videos and engagement.
